## Motion Planning with Dijkstra Algorithm

### Description:
- Dijkstra's Algorithm finds the shortest path between two given nodes.
- It uses weights defined by edges to explore and chooses the edges which minimizes these weights to obtain the shortest path
- The outcome of this project is for self-learning to understand the working of Dijkstra's algorithm and it's application for planning of non-holonomic robots


### Dependencies:
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

### Instructions to run:
```
# Enter the project directory
cd <project_directory>

# Create a test_case folder
mkdir test_case

# Run the main script
python3 main.py
```

### Demo: 

Initial Node: [16, 35]
Final Node: [30, 85]
