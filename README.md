## Motion Planning with Dijkstra Algorithm

### Description:
- Dijkstra's Algorithm finds the shortest path between two given nodes.
- It uses weights defined by edges to explore and chooses the edges which minimizes these weights to obtain the shortest path
- The outcome of this project is for self-learning to understand the working of Dijkstra's algorithm and it's application for planning of non-holonomic robots


### Dependencies:
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
